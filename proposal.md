## Risks and assumptions:


-	The user should be able to login into page using email id and password
-	Displaying the different dashboards for each of the accounts Admin, User, and Committe User.
-	Making sure the system is compatible with all web browsers (Firefox, Google Chrome,Internet Explorer, Safari, Edge, etc.)
-	MySQL database that holds all info on organizations, organization's events and user informaqtion.
-	Admin should be able to view a list of all organizations, organization's events and the user who registered for the particular events.
