We are planning to develop this project using Vue JS as a frontend framework, Adonis JS as a backend framework, and MySQL as a database server because we require the structured data to be stored(because relations are more efficient in Structured data).

 Stack:
## Backend
- AdonisJs

## Host
- Heroku

## Data Host
- Heroku PostgreSQL


## Frontend
- Vue JS

## Front-end responsive design
- Bootstrap



for frontend i have updated vuejs pdf document for preperation

[link to adonisjs documentation for the reference ](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/introduction)




- Created a Demo Repo for the project 
 - And pushed basic backend code to repo [link here](https://github.com/saikiranreddygangidi/demo_connectCompany/tree/main/connectcompanyAPI)
